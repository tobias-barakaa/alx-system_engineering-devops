Task Description:

The task involves fixing a web server setup using Nginx.
The issue is related to a high number of failed requests when benchmarking with ApacheBench.
You were supposed to bring the number of failed requests down to 0.
Solution Steps:

You ran ApacheBench to benchmark the server before making any changes. In the initial test, 943 out of 2000 requests failed.

You used Puppet to apply a manifest file (0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp) to make the necessary changes to the Nginx configuration.

After applying the Puppet manifest, you ran ApacheBench again to benchmark the server. In the second test, you achieved 0 failed requests.

Outcome:

Before applying the changes, the server had a high number of failed requests (943 out of 2000).
After applying the changes using Puppet, the server successfully handled all 2000 requests without any failures.
The provided information does not include the actual content of the 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp file, so I cannot provide specific details about the changes you made in the Puppet manifest. If you need further assistance or have specific questions about the changes made in the manifest, please provide the content of the 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp file, and I can help you analyze it.
