Design of One-Server Web Infrastructure:

User Scenario: A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com.

Server:

A single server hosts the entire web infrastructure.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx serves as the web server software.
It handles incoming HTTP requests from users' web browsers.
Application Server:

An application server runs on the server to process dynamic content requests.
It executes the codebase and generates dynamic content (HTML pages).
Application Files (Code Base):

The code base consists of the website's source code and assets required for its operation.
It resides on the server and is executed by the application server.
Database (MySQL):

A MySQL database is installed on the server to store website data.
It holds information such as user accounts, articles, and settings.
Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

The domain name "www.foobar.com" is configured to point to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) through a DNS record.
Specifics about the Infrastructure:

What is a server:

A server is a powerful computer that hosts and serves the website.
It runs various software components like the web server, application server, and database to handle user requests.
What is the role of the domain name:

The domain name "www.foobar.com" is a human-readable address used by users to access the website.
It acts as a user-friendly alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) where the website is hosted.
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com:

The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a subdomain.
Typically, it is configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the main domain (foobar.com) or directly to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
What is the role of the web server:

Nginx serves as the web server.
It handles incoming HTTP requests from users' web browsers and serves static content directly.
For dynamic content requests, Nginx forwards the requests to the application server.
What is the role of the application server:

The application server processes dynamic content requests from the web server.
It executes the codebase (PHP scripts in this case) and interacts with the database to generate dynamic content (HTML pages).
What is the role of the database:

MySQL serves as the database.
It stores and manages website data, such as user accounts and content.
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website:

The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the user's computer.
When a user requests the website (www.foobar.com), their web browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), and the server responds with the appropriate web content.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

This infrastructure relies on a single server, making it a single point of failure.
If the server experiences hardware issues or downtime, the entire website becomes inaccessible until the server is restored.
Downtime during Maintenance:

During maintenance activities, such as deploying new code or updates, the web server (Nginx) or application server might need to be restarted.
This can cause downtime, temporarily making the website unavailable to users.
Cannot Scale with High Traffic:

As a one-server infrastructure, it will face limitations in scaling to handle a large volume of incoming traffic.
If the website experiences a surge in visitors, the server may struggle to keep up with the demand.
